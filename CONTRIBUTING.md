# Contributing

## Debug

- `npm run webpack-dev`
- Then just debug the extension from vscode

## Publish

We'll use the `vsce` package, so install it once globally:
- `npm install -g vsce`

To publish a version:
- `npm `
- `vsce package`: Packages this into a vsix
- `vsce publish`: Publishes the package to store
